**JavaScript - Data Structures**

<br />

<h1>Data Structures</h1>

Data Structures - A efficient way to manage and organize data.

In this section, we'll cover about "Stack".

It is based on the principle of "Last In - First Out" LIFO. We can assume it as the pile of books.

The element which entered the stack first will be the one which will be last to leave the stack. Kind of a reverse to "Queue" data structure.

<h1>The list of operations which could be performed on stack: </h1>

push()

pop()

isEmpty()

peek()
